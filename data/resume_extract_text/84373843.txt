Summary: Summary To obtain a position where I can be an asset to the company, along with development of new skills. Highlights 4 years experience with Query, Access, Excel, Control D, Lotus Notes, Oracle, Peoplesoft, Billing online system Thrives under pressure Excellent time management skills Analytical Customer-oriented Basic understanding of Quicken  Computer proficient Critical thinking Financial statement analysis  Accomplishments Assisted in the centralization of accounting to the Bloomington-Normal corporate office.  When multiple co-workers were out of the office I covered all of the PZ01 forms that came into the mail box processing over 99% of them and keeping the team from falling behind on them for that day receiving an \"On the Spot\" award for my accomplishment.  I hold the record for the most Premium Fund Account reviews to be done in 1 day on my team completing 16 reviews in 1 day while still maintaining a quality score of 97%.  Came up with multiple ideas to make processes on our team more efficient for example sometimes we would get questions about what review materials we have received and what we still need from agents and we would have to go pull the file and locate it in the file room every time but instead I suggested we all get read only access to the tool we use to check in materials to be able to see on demand what they are missing and what we still need so no longer did we need to go track down files to complete this task.
