Summary: SALES Summary When thinking of the timeline of my career, numerous bullet points come to mind. Whether it be a skill or achievement that I can bring to the table, there is one common denominator that all of these personal traits fall under: Teamwork. Regardless of what job I may have had in the past, whether it be music education, recruiting, or sales, understanding that I am existing within/leading a team allows me to clearly understand the task at hand. Communication is the number one element to a successful team. A prolonged lack of communication can manifest itself into a negative environment, and it has been my number one priority to make sure everyone involved is on the same page.
