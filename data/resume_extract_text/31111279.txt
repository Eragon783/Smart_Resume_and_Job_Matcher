Summary: Professional Summary Highly motivated and driven Manager of the Project Management Office (PMO). Currently seeking potential opportunities to continue to help other organizations realize and reap benefits of formal PMO methodology. Passionate about PMO engagement in health care, as I have watched over 17 years of what was once lacking in this industry, take hold and prove its value and worth. I have had the pleasure and benefit of watching three organizations grow and blossom their teams with training and growth and development of a methodology that fits the culture of each organization.
