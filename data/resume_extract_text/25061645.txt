Summary: A graphic designer who is creative and detail-oriented; who thinks a lot, but wants to make things clear and simple. Simple without loss of information is my style. Pay attention and be accurate to each pixel is the phrase I will always keep in mind during my design career. Right now I'm looking for a suitable position in a company that has a team of pleasant, experienced designers and a working environment, which allows people to grow and succeed.
