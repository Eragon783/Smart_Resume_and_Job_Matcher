Summary: My main goal is to ensure that procedures are followed for seating and serving guests. I aim to ensure staff act in a way that promotes guest satisfaction and handle any issues or complaints. I will design and implement training for servers, bussers, hosts, baristas, and bartenders. This training will involve training on menu items, as well as shadowing other servers to learn the restaurant's procedures and standards. I will work side by side with the kitchen management and team to assist with cost controls by helping develop systems to manage product waste, labor costs, and breakage. I will oversee facility upkeep, ensuring that the front of house areas are clean and meet restaurant standards while arranging that repairs are made in a timely manner and I will perform facilities maintenance as needed.
