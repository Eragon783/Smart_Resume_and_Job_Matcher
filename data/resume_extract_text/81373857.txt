Summary: Mature college student. Interested in part time work in areas such as retail, health services, security, information technology, and food services. The past six years I have been involved in a men's mentor group named BoyzN2Men. As a high school student I started as one of the entry level attendees and worked my way to one of the top officers of the core. The program has taught me the importance of responsibility, accountability, integrity of character and other virtues of life that will help me in the work place. During my high school senior year I was actively involved with the student government association (SGA). I was the secretary of arms, highly reliable and very attentive during my time as the active secretary. Also have experienced in taking food orders, operating cash registers and safely handling food while checking for proper temperatures.
