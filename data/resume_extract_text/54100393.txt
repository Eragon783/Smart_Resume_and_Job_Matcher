Summary: I am passionate about teaching and caring for students holistically. I believe it is crucial for students to develop critical thinking skills as they develop their sense of self and their worldview. I prioritize teacher collaboration to develop a community among educators and to develop best practices. I pursue professional development opportunities to better serve all of my students with an emphasis on equity, differentiation and inquiry-based learning. I have recently completed my National Board Certification pending results in January of 2019.
