Summary: Professional Summary I've been working in the Technical Support field for the last 4+ years honing my professional skills as well as applying a personality that has lead me to work directly with senior level clients. This has involved traveling across the country installing hardware/software; as well as training/supporting clients in a high stress environment in the television broadcast/automotive industries. I am not just looking for a specific position, but a company that promotes internal growth, rewards hard work, and is a place people are happy to work at.
