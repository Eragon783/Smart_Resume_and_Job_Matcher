Summary: Highly motivated Civil Engineer with 16 years of experience working for one of North America's largest and most respected construction and engineering organizations with revenues of more than $11 billion, consistently ranking among the top five contractors by Engineering News-Record. Experience with Kiewit prepared me to plan and execute projects promoting safety, quality, schedule, and cost performance. Career ranges from design coordinator on a multi-billion dollar design-build project to on-site project engineering and project management for self-performing heavy civil construction work ranging from $545 million to $3.1 million. Skilled in construction means and methods, cost controls, scheduling, claims analysis and contract administration. As Field Engineer and Project Controls Manager on one of the largest design-build projects in Maryland, I manage approximately 1,000 WBS activities on a P6 schedule. Despite a six-month delay in the award, the project remained substantially complete on the original completion date.
