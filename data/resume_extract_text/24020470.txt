Summary: Over twelve years of experience providing high quality consulting and technical assistance to home and business end users. As a field service technician since late 2004, I am able to install, repair and maintain many types of Point of Sale register equipment as well as servers, networking and related peripherals. With an ability to integrate computer skills, customer support experience and related education I thrive to exceed technical, business, and customer expectations. A long time hobby of mine is demonstrating electronics in retail stores. I really enjoy in store demonstrations, direct sales and training sessions with employees. Continuing to improve myself is very important to me. I feel being professionally certified by CompTIA, Lexmark, Hewlett Packard, Microsoft, Fujitsu, IC3, the ETA, FEMA and other bodies allows me to think outside the box and create a custom solution that best fits the client\'s needs.
