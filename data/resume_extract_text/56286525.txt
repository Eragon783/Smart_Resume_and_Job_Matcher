Summary: A highly accomplished, versatile and respected professional with over 12 years in Terminal Operations at the Port of Los Angeles. Terminal Operations is a time sensitive, high pressure, and diverse environment which you collaboratively work with customers, the union work force, and internal management along with federal, state and local agencies to navigate a myriad of contract rules, regulations, lease agreements and laws. As an Operations Manager, I have advanced knowledge in working with all facets of terminal operations; Customer Service, Rail, Vessel, Terminal planning and yard functions. Initiated cost reductions, stream-lined dock work functions and similar to an industrial designer reconfigured and maximized the use of terminal space to accommodate the growth in volume. Consistently achieves outstanding results in complex situations while building and maintaining strong, loyal relations with clients, colleagues and staff. Being a leader in this environment challenges you to think beyond the simple choice and reach for the impossible answers while maintaining the integrity of all the moving parts.
