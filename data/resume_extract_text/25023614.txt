Summary: Head designer for a Realtor developer, I have worked creating spaces and collaborating with contractors and architects. Developing innovative concepts and uses for the spaces. For my residential work I go beyond the surface thinking of the function and the style of the space, while working within a budget. Detail-oriented and the ability to learn concepts quickly. Excellent research, time management, and problem solving skills. Networking with suppliers and merchants in the area, allowing access to the newest materials and furnishings. Meeting with clients to find out what their wants and needs are, with consideration to their space and budget. Creating a design plan using CAD and developing professional boards to show the concept of the space. Following up with clients upon project's completion to make sure they are satisfied. All this is done to help grow their business and brand.
