Summary: My name is Evan Elias, I have recently made the important decision about my career. Computers are going fast and the world of computers is expanding to all the corners of the earth. I want to be part of this ever-evolving staple of humanity. I also want to be able to cook and provide for people who cannot do it themselves and be a contributor to technology in my course of life. I have taken many classes on programming and taught myself about the IT aspect of computers. I am very strong in math and I like to solve problems. I have taken many cooking classes and have worked in every position in a kitchen. Highlights I am very good under pressure from the experiences in the restaurant industry. I am very good with Technology whether it be solving a simple internet bug or it being a big list of coding.
