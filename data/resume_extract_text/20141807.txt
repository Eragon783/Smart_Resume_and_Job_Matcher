Summary: I have been with IBC for nearly a year, and I am looking forward to continuing my career as the Sales Lead for the Moore Branch. I am determined to help my branch continue to grow, and I am excited to continue to develop our Tellers and Sales Associates into outstanding, motivated, and productive IBC employees. I tried my very best to make sure our customers were satisfied and had a great experience at our dealership.
