Creating and maintaining the materials library by ordering; materials, fabric samples, finishes, and design accessories. Meet with clients, presenting the design plan and then reviewing the design plan according to the client's input. Confirming the design plan, specifying materials, finishes, lighting and flooring. Supervising the project to make sure it is done properly and according to the time-line. August 2013 I started a new build of 3,200 sq. ft. it's a shoreline home in West Brook. Everything custom designed from cabinetry with handpicked fixtures, staircases, fireplace, window treatments, to some of the furniture, all custom crafted pulled together in a seamless way reflective of clients' personality. I oversaw that the project was properly planned by working closely with contractor allowing to complete on time and within budget. May 2012 I started the remodeling and updating a North Haven home. Up to date I have remodeled the den, living room, and the dining room. In the summer of 2011, I interned at New England Kitchen and Bath in Glastonbury, CT, working with their head designer, Abbey Miller. We were able to go through the process of a job start to finish. We went through the steps of designing and computer modeling of new spaces, the ordering of top quality materials and fixtures, to overseeing the scheduling and workmanship of installers. In the summer of 2009, I worked in East Hampton, New York at the Grand Acquisitor, an upscale Antique Dealer. The store specialized in antiques such as; decorative accessories, lace, linens, silver, and furniture. The key to succeeding in the antiques business is knowledge. I was able to see 18th and 19th century furniture, clothes, accessories, and more. Here I learned purchasing skills and the ability to spot a good find. I also recorded and kept track of the inventory as well as helped in setting up displays."
