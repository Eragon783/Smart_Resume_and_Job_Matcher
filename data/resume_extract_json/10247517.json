Evaluates, recommends, implements, supports, and troubleshoots hardware and software. Maintains LAN/WAN infrastructure, connectivity, and security as well as LAN user documentation. Performs disaster recovery planning. Administers licenses and service contracts; schedules service visits from vendors and suppliers. Defines, documents, assesses, and updates IT-related procedures as needed. Creates and maintains user accounts, including email. Inspects all employees' computers quarterly to ensure compliance with office policies. Coordinates special projects. Designed and implemented network infrastructure enhancements to improve performance, security, remote access, and connectivity. Standardized hardware, peripherals, and software. Established a helpdesk support system for monitoring, prioritizing, and scheduling requests. Spearheaded the deployment of a new tracking system that provided performance metrics used to identify where additional training and resources were required. Researched, installed, and configured an enterprise backup solution for disaster recovery that included features to allow users to recover deleted items without the need to recover from DR backups. Doubled WAN bandwidth and propelled LAN and WLAN performance to 100% or higher through WAN, LAN, and WLAN reconfiguration. Improved accuracy, more than doubled efficiency from 35% to 87%, and increased cost savings from $250/quarter to $2,500/quarter by developing an automated script for retrieving data from an outside server. Automated asset tracking by employing a hand scanner and database system to improve efficiency and accuracy."

Led a team of five network and equipment support specialists. Configured, maintained, analyzed, and troubleshot Nortel and Juniper networks, systems, and equipment (WAN/LAN/WLAN infrastructure, servers, PCs, notebooks, thin clients, printers, and other peripherals) used by 600 workers in Georgia. Supported 200 units configured for operation through client servers. Advanced global company objectives through participation in IT and telecom design and implementation. Advanced to this role through promotions from Mechanical Drafter, Engineering Checker, Mechanical Designer, and Network Administrator. Slashed support requests 75%, cut equipment costs 50%, and boosted work productivity 30% by applying near-zero configuration to develop, install, and implement a thin client solution for 90 plant manufacturing cells. Reduced standard company imaging and system deployment time 60% before station-specific customization by replacing and/or refreshing 40 PCs each quarter, 100% on schedule. Planned, designed, installed, configured, and tested wireless networks (WLAN from Cisco, Nortel, and Meraki) in multiple facilities; documented standards for US operations; trained users; and monitored performance. Replaced 125 field and service laptops by programming standard images and custom configurations on each machine, completing the six-week project on schedule despite disruption of parts availability due to a tsunami. Championed the use of computers in manufacturing cells to provide drawings and also facilitate order tracking in conjunction with the ERP system; designed and implemented automated pick list and shipping documents as well as real-time tracking for distribution. Trained and mentored 15 new department staff members and contractors."
