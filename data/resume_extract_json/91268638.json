            "description": "As an Event Lead I was expected to deliver an eating experience that reflected the integrity and reputation of the company I was employed by. In doing so I was responsible for managing an event team of up to 40 people at times. This included but was not limited to delegating responsibilities, managing break and leave times, loading/delivering, and training new employees. As a Prep Cook I prepared food, desserts, and drinks according to recipes and specifications from the executive chef. I also cooled, stored, and labeled according to industry and health code standards. I was able to have creative input during menu planning. As the Assistant Pastry Chef I was responsible for completing a daily prep list (ie. cakes, cookies, breads, pastries, and candies etc.) according to chef specifications and recipes while utilizing various baking methods and equipment. I was also in charge of training and assisting two other bakers in their daily prep. Also facilitating meetings regarding performance. After my Exec Pastry Chef left I was then responsible for scheduling, making prep lists, ordering from various vendors, attending weekly BEO meetings, menu planning and wedding cake deliveries."
