            "description": "Utilize extensive organizational skills to maintain daily logs and supplement inspection records with photographs. Meticulously review and interpret plans, blueprints, site layouts, specifications and construction methods to effectively ensure compliance to legal requirements and safety regulations. Supervise 18 project employees, including in-house, external contractors, and sub-contractors. Methodically ensure projects are progressing as per schedule and in accordance with local building codes and laws. Utilized extensive engineering skills to perform field duties, including post-tension and conventional reinforcing steel inspection, concrete placement inspection, masonry inspection, sampling and testing, high-strength bolting and welding inspections done at various project sites. Systematically conducted ongoing inspection of work-in-process to ensure final product successfully met drawings and specifications. Assisted subordinates in understanding the process to increase staff skill levels. Skillfully inspected materials to identify conformance to specifications, construction of surface street improvements and equipment installation activities to ensure conformity of products and systems with engineering design. Expertly prepared comprehensive and concise daily reports to accurately reflect the day's construction activities with details. Meticulously maintained up-to-date project records, as delegated by construction manager, including as-built drawings, material testing reports, miscellaneous inspection and testing reports, item quantity files and others as determined by construction manager to ensure comprehensive record of activities. Evaluated quality of materials used and inspected them and quality of work completed to ensure all materials and work met requirements. Employed extensive analytical skills to check plans for accuracy, suitability and completeness, and made recommendations for revision and improvement when necessary. Proficiently arranged meetings with architects and builders to devise a plan to help builders save time while building structures as per zoning rules and standards. Effectively provided daily feedback on construction work to builders and architects, and expertly advised them on the changes needed for compliance. Reliably conducted ongoing inspection of work-in-process to ensure final product met drawings and specifications. Liaise with clients and a variety of professionals including architects and subcontractors in a professional manner. Utilize extensive engineering skills to proficiently conduct site inspections. Meticulously complete complex and repetitive calculations to ensure construction conforms to code. Ensure the project effectively complies with all legal requirements. Assess the sustainability and environmental impact of project to ensure the environment is protected. Inspect inventories and prepared orders for civil projects and refractory materials in line with budgeted figures averaging $2,000,000; coordinated and conducted section trials."
