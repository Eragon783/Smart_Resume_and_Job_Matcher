    "summary": "I intend to practice general endocrinology; however I am pursuing additional training in the area of obesity medicine and hope to bring this expertise to the practice I join. My background in nutrition science and exercise, as well as my clinical experience in weight management and bariatric clinics, and research endeavors in clinical weight loss trials will enable me to develop the skills I need to supervise and direct patients in their weight loss efforts. I am open to working in both the inpatient and outpatient setting as my fellowship training has equipped me to manage inpatient diabetes and endocrine consults.",
