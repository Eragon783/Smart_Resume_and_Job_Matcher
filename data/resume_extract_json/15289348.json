            "description": "Special Project: Clear aged variances from Fixed Maintenance & Prepaid Maintenance GL Accounts. Starting January 2014 reduced leasing contract variances for Fixed Pass-Through and Prepaid Maintenance accounts. Worked with Project Manager and Financial Adjustments to clear aged variances. Resulted in the development of the new process and GAO Variance Tool for tracking variances for Maintenance and other GL accounts by Financial Adjustments. Since taking over the Fixed Maintenance Recs in Oct. 2012: Researched and found causes of variances from 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. Worked with Financial Adjustments/ Funding to facilitate the review and clearance of issues. Reduced specific large Vendor credits owed from over $35,700.00 to $0. Reduced Payables on HOLD from over $96,000.00 to $0.00. Decreased the contract variances caused by incorrect dispositions over 365 days with balances from Over $163,000.00 down to less than $25,000.00 in balances from 2006-2011. Reduced overall outstanding aging variances aged under 60 days in the Bank Holding Company GL from over $302,000.00 to less than $900.00 and in the Bank GL from over $111,000.00 to under $25.00 aged under 60 days (to be clawed back). Cleaned up and streamlined the Fixed Maintenance recs and procedures. Exposed a flaw in the Funding process where Voided checks and failed ACH's were not routinely monitored and re-issued, and the process of monitoring Payments on HOLD to Dealers that owed CIT money, resulting in the new API process for setting up payables in a separate account from all GL accounts to track all payables, liabilities and receivables. Special Project: Worked 3 months on a “Fire Project” for Corporate Accounting - Sales Tax Project with Corporate Sales Tax group to help streamline backlogged sales tax reports for filing. Reviewed, analyzed and Reconciled Fixed Maintenance Receivable and Payable accounts; Prepaid Maintenance Payables, Receivables & Unearned Income accounts; Managed Net Investment accounts; Escheatment Accounts; Property Tax Reserve Accounts; Sales Tax Receivable, Sales Tax Payable, and Reserved Value Insurance accounts for Bank Holding Company and Bank.
