            "description": "Managed and lead by example a team of qualified marketing and clinical liaisons and showed steady increase in census and market presence. Accomplishments included opening doors to new Acute care hospitals that are now responsible for 5-10% of new LTAC admissions each month, for instance Angleton-Danbury Medical Center, Brazosport Regional Medical Center, University General Hospital and Memorial Hermann Medical Center. Brought on board several new physicians that specialize in the needs of long term acute care patients. This resulted in the higher referrals from the Acute care hospitals by these certain physicians and increased total number of admissions. Record rate of admissions and discharges beyond 26 day stay at the LTAC. Highest census to date since the opening of the establishment at over 88% for a continuous streak of 40+ days. Designed a processing system of new referrals which cut down the processing time of referrals from 72 hours to 12 hours or less, with over 90%referrals that turned in to same day admissions. Designed and printed a new and improved \"LTACH Evaluation Status\" sheet for patient charts which communication the status of referrals to the case managers and physicians efficiently, so that they don't have to follow up constantly with the admissions staff over the phone. Designed and uploaded a new company website that enables patients to do virtual tours, sign consents and view the directions to the hospital on the web. In addition, it is much more visibly pleasing compared to the older website and offers detailed information on private health care insurances accepted by the hospital and explains the services offered by the hospital including the \"continuum of care\" model. Designed and rented a full-size CBS Billboard for over one year in the Sugar Land on Hwy 6 and Hwy 99 intersection, to increase the market presence in the community. Catered special needs patients and their families with their requests in order to secure admissions, for instance; Halal or Kosher meals, Allowing only one family member to stay with the patient for the duration of stay etc. Initiated the tradition of annual company gala in which the doctors who actively contributed in the hospital referrals were recognized and presented with award and gifts. This also soon became a sought after event by the case manager and social workers to attend as it is a one of a kind evening, where guests are entertained with dances, live singing performances, five course dinner and an open bar."
