Used Python - 'Random Forest Classifier' to predict malignant tumors in breast tissue. Here, main idea is building multiple models with different sample and different initial variables from train data set. Goal is to determine what attributes provide the most information that can be used to predict malignancy. My model was tested against 'test data set' for accuracy and it is 96% successful in predicting whether the tumor is malignant or benign. Data Mining- Image Classification: It is the process to categorize images into one of several categories. Classification requires training for each image category. Constructed Training and Test data for given image data using Java programming. Constructed the five different classifier models using each training data file. Tested these classifiers using test data and compared the prediction accuracies among five different classifiers. Achieved 95% accuracy."
