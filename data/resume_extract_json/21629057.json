            "description": "Developed and built, complex RF systems for broadcasters worldwide. Tested at the component level and built the systems. Worked closely with the staff engineers and engineering department as well as customers to be certain the end users needs were met. I was also responsible for equipment maintenance and calibrations being kept up to date. I was also responsible for the low voltage control wiring for protection circuitry and system operations both as components and at a system level. Field service engineering, install and provide proof of performance to the end user and transmitter manufacturer, Some of my field work was on an emergent basis due to equipment failure or improper operation. Sales to the broadcaster. Also provided feedback to our engineering department for proper record keeping. Limited machine shop work in model making for R&D projects. Interfaced with other suppliers and the respective engineering departments to ensure proper operation. Implemented schematics, diagrams and written and verbal descriptions to effectively solve engineering project issues. Completed projects by effectively applying engineering, technical and maintenance procedures. Used precision test equipment such as oscilloscopes, multi-meters, waveform generators and spectrum analyzers Collaborated with engineers at the new product introduction phase to develop and verify design changes. Initiated contact with vendors and built solid working relationships with them. Followed up on manufacturing and field reports and resolved outstanding problems. Compiled, processed and analyzed test data and results to improve product quality."

Field service engineering, Wiring of microprocessor controlled RF systems and system assembly and tests, modeling and design of some components working with the engineers and drafting department. Responsible for installation and proof of performance test, as well as repair of products at the customer's site. Feed back provided to the engineering departments well as training for the end user, Made sure the manuals were up to date and accurate, some sales of new products and often times working with the engineers within other companies to resolve engineering issues as they arose in the field. Responsible for maintaining the calibration of test equipment. Major accomplishments Improved product quality by customizing tools and eliminating variability. Followed up on manufacturing and field reports and resolved outstanding problems. Conducted engineering and detailed experimental tests to collect design data and assist in research work."

SPS 49 Radar component test, to including pattern test of the reflector and waveguide components. Accomplishments Reduced test time and increased production of the SPS-49 reflector from 2 days to less than one without sacrificing quality. Interfaced with the Raytheon Representative to demonstrate test results as well as test methodology. Skills used a thorough understanding of RF Propagation and cause and effect of structures on radiation patterns.
