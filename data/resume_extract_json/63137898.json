It was a time of change, automation of the manufacturing process, and upgrading software to SAP. This is where I fell in love with accounting and helping the manufacturing team understand how it worked for them or against them. During my time at Colgate, I was involved in the cost of unions, strikes, complete downsizing of administrative roles, different general managers of the facility, and working with New York on monthly reports and annual budgets. Other projects included the creation of the Cost Accounting system and processes with the CPA firm hired to implement the software. My counter-part and I flew up to NY each week to work on this and then flew back each Thursday to work on our regular jobs. Once SAP was up and running for Colgate, I was transferred to Hill's Pet Nutrition in Topeka, KS as the Cost Accounting Manager to implement SAP."
