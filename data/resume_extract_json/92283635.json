Prepared and shipped about 250 metric tons worth of military equipment on numerous operations to countries such as Australia, Thailand and Guam. Equipment had to be tied down at certain points and sometimes in complex ways to ensure proper restraint when loaded on an aircraft. In charge of three Marines who occasionally were deployed to other countries. Never missed a time frame for any of the 13 operations that we participated in. Provided cleaning supplies, office supplies and other miscellaneous items for an entire squadron. Without that support, the squadron would not have been able to operate."
