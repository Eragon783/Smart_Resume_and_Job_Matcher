Steady State Multiphase Flow Simulation of pipelines using Pipesim considering Flow Assurance Strategies. Designed 3D models of Subsea Systems using SolidWorks. Analyzed the mechanical systems including FEA for Structural and Fatigue. Delivered a Drilling Riser design document in 3 days that usually takes 1-2 weeks. Standardized MS Excel template to expedite the design calculation process in few hours that would take days. Recommended efficient design to reduce cost while manufacturing. Gained knowledge pertaining to 3D Modelling, Product Design, OCTG, Project Management, Project Engineering, Stress Analysis, Wall thickness evaluation and Tension force calculations. Gained experience in applying industry codes for offshore oil and gas projects. Conversant with Flow Assurance Strategies, API RP 2A, API RP 1111, DNV-OS-F101, ASME B31.8, DNV-RP-F110, DNV-RP-E305, DNV-RP-F101; riser analysis codes: API-RP-2RD and drilling riser analysis code: API-RP-16Q."

Studied P&ID's, Wiring Diagrams and Manuals; recommended economic maintenance solutions. Developed prototype of a heat exchanger with an integrated hydrophobic coating that costed $10 per foot. Succeeded in increasing condensation rate by 27%, making it more environment friendly. Proposed a model that was 21% compact and 22% ($18k) less expensive, that performs equally well in comparison with present heat exchangers. Submitted a report with scope for improvement in innovative design and reduced cost."
