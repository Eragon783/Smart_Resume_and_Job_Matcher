Backend Developer Location: Israel GitHub LinkedIn Experience Skills Languages: Golang Developer Golang, Java, Python, Sber Technologies C++ Nov 2021 - Present Technologies: Developed microservice backend in Golang for a new project an educational platform that PostgreSQL, offers user-created scenarios and a sandbox virtual environment each time you start a lesson MongoDB, Redis, My responsibilities mostly included writing APIs (REST, WebSocket, gRPC) and developing Kafka business features Other: Detected and fixed multiple non-obvious bugs regarding virtual environment sessions timeouts, REST, gRPC, increasing overall product stability Microservices, Machine Learning Engineer Intern Prometheus, Linux/Bash, Docker, RingCentral SQL May 2019 - Oct 2019 Worked closely with Data Scientists, building data transformation pipelines, delivering ML Education models to production and building REST APIs for model predictions, all using Python Projects I participated in were a recommendation system and a fraud detection service Applied Mathematics and Informatics Other projects Saint-Petersburg Academic University FerretDB Aug 2019 - July 2023 I made some contributions to an open-source project FerretDB (>5k stars on GitHub), an open- Algorithmic Biology source alternative to MongoDB written in Golang that uses Postgres at its core for document storage. Working on this project made me learn a lot about subtleties of MongoDB Bioinformatics Institute Aug 2020 - June 2021 Apache Ranger and OpenSearch Integration The project was a part of a summer school event/hackathon held by Samsung in Sept 2021. We Also were offered a problem of integrating OpenSearch, a for of ElasticSearch, with an authentication system Apache Ranger. Our team was able to propose a solution, getting 2nd place in the Languages: English (C1), hackathon out of 20 participants Russian (native) Good at Linux Improving GraphBin2 Metagenomic Data Binning Algorithm This was a course project in my university. The goal of the project was research, performance evaluation and possible improvement of a novel algorithm for genomic data classification GraphBin2 Georgy Ginzburg 1
